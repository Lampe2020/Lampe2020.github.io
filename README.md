# Welcome to my GitHub Page!
I'm Christian Lampe (a.k.a. `Lampe2020`), a German/Swedish young hobby programmer. I have _a whole bunch_ of unfinished and abandoned projects on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/Lampe2020), but there are a few interesting things there as well:   
- [Stackowey](https://github.com/Lampe2020/stackowey) (my own esoteric programming language, my first to actually start executing code written in it) and [the online IDE for it](https://lampe2020.github.io/stackowey-ide)   
- [L7z](https://github.com/Lampe2020/L7z), a 7zFM reimplementation for \*NIXes, semi-stale right now because I am working on so much other stuff   
- [A Bedtime Oath](https://lampe2020.de/extras/spiele/a-bedtime-oath) (developed in a private repo here on GitHub, I intend to make it source-available or even open-source once it's (at least semi-)complete)
   
My main website is [Lampe2020.de](https://lampe2020.de), where I do most of my web technology stuff.   
I am also on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/Lampe2020), but quite inactive there, but if low-production-value Minecraft gameplay interests you, there's a bit to watch.
